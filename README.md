# Software Renderers
Two software renderers with similar feature sets (model loading and scenes). One is a ray tracer
and the other is a rasterizer.

## Getting Started
To compile this project you only need a C++ compiler and CMake installed on your computer. You also need
OpenGL 3.3 drivers for your graphics card, but it was released in 2010, so you probably already have them.
To setup run the following git commands and use CMake with any compatible IDE and/or from the command line.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BenjaminTSmith/software-renderers.git
cd software-renderers
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
